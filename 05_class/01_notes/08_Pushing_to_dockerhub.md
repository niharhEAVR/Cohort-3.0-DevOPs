### **How to Push a Docker Image to Docker Hub** 🚀  

#### **1️⃣ Sign Up & Sign In to Docker Hub**  
1. Go to **[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)**.  
2. **Sign up** if you don’t have an account.  
3. **Sign in** after registration.  

---

### **2️⃣ Push Your Dockerfile to Docker Hub**  
To upload your Docker image to Docker Hub, first log in using:  
```sh
docker login
```
You will see a message like this:  
```sh
Authenticating with existing credentials...
Login Succeeded
```
This means Docker authenticated you successfully.  

---

### **3️⃣ How Did `docker login` Authenticate Without Asking for Credentials?** 🤔  
If Docker **did not ask for credentials**, it means **you are already logged in**, and Docker **retrieved stored credentials** from your system.  

---

### **4️⃣ Where Are Docker Credentials Stored?** 🔐  
Docker **stores login credentials** in a configuration file called `config.json`.  

📌 **Location of `config.json`:**  
- **Linux/macOS:** `~/.docker/config.json`  
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.docker\config.json`  

---

### **5️⃣ How to View Stored Credentials?**  
🔍 Open `config.json` with a text editor or command line:  
```sh
cat ~/.docker/config.json   # Linux/macOS
type C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.docker\config.json   # Windows
```
Example output:  
```json
{
  "auths": {
    "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {}
  },
  "credsStore": "desktop",
  "currentContext": "desktop-linux",
  "plugins": {
    "-x-cli-hints": {
      "enabled": "true"
    }
  },
  "features": {
    "hooks": "true"
  }
}
```
It means **Docker is using an external credential store (`credsStore: "desktop"`) instead of storing credentials in `config.json`**.  

---

### **8️⃣ Where Are My Docker Credentials Stored?** 🔐  
Since `"credsStore": "desktop"` is set, credentials are stored securely in your OS’s credential manager.

📌 **Credential Storage Based on OS:**  

| OS | Credential Storage |
|----|-------------------|
| **Windows** | Windows Credential Manager |
| **macOS** | macOS Keychain |
| **Linux** | `pass` (Password Store) |

---

### **9️⃣ How to View Stored Docker Credentials?** 👀  

#### **🟢 Windows (Credential Manager)**
1. Open **Windows Credential Manager** (`Win Search Bar`, then type `Credential Manager`).  
2. Look under **"Windows Credentials"**.  
3. Find an entry for `Docker Credentials` or `https://index.docker.io/v1/`.  

---

#### **🍏 macOS (Keychain Access)**
1. Open **Keychain Access** (`Cmd + Space`, then search for "Keychain Access").  
2. Look for an entry named **"Docker Credentials"**.  
3. Click on it and select **"Show Password"** (it will ask for your macOS password).  

---

#### **🐧 Linux (Pass Store)**
1. Check if `pass` is installed:  
   ```sh
   pass
   ```
2. List stored credentials:  
   ```sh
   pass show docker-credential-desktop
   ```
If `pass` is not installed, Docker may not be storing credentials.

---

### **🔟 How to Remove Stored Docker Credentials?**  

If you **want Docker to ask for a username/password again**, follow these steps:

1️⃣ **Log out of Docker Hub:**  
```sh
docker logout
```
This **removes the credentials** from `config.json`.  

2️⃣ **Remove Credentials Manually:**  
- **Windows:** Delete Docker-related entries in **Credential Manager**.  
- **macOS:** Remove **Docker credentials** from **Keychain Access**.  
- **Linux:** Run:  
  ```sh
  pass rm docker-credential-desktop
  ```

3️⃣ **Log in again:**  
```sh
docker login
```

### **Docker Logout & Login: Observations**  

I noticed something interesting when using `docker logout`. When I log out, the credentials are completely removed from the **Windows Credential Manager** (or macOS Keychain/Linux password manager). Then, when I try logging in again using `docker login`, I see this:  

```sh
docker login

USING WEB-BASED LOGIN
To sign in with credentials on the command line, use 'docker login -u <username>'

Your one-time device confirmation code is: MHPP-DNZX
Press ENTER to open your browser or submit your device code here: https://login.docker.com/activate

Waiting for authentication in the browser…
```

To complete the login process, I need to visit **`https://login.docker.com/activate`**, enter the confirmation code, and then Docker successfully logs me in again.

---

### **Important Observation About Docker Login**  

When using `docker login`, it's crucial that you are already signed into Docker Hub with the **same email address** in your web browser.  

- ✅ **If you are already logged into Docker Hub in your browser** (with the same email used for Docker), you can simply enter the **one-time confirmation code**, and login will succeed immediately.  
- ❌ **If you are NOT logged into Docker Hub in your browser**, you will first need to sign in before entering the confirmation code.  

This means that your browser session plays a key role in the authentication process. If you're switching between multiple accounts, ensure you are logged into the correct Docker Hub account before pasting the code.

---

```sh
Login Succeeded
```

---

### **Why Does Docker Require Web-Based Login?** 🤔  

Docker now supports **OAuth-based authentication** instead of requiring you to enter a username and password directly in the terminal. This method:  

✅ **Enhances security** – Your credentials are never stored in plaintext in `config.json`.  
✅ **Prevents credential leaks** – No need to type your password in a terminal.  
✅ **Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA)** – If enabled, Docker will prompt for MFA during login.  

---

### **How Does `docker login` Work?**  

1️⃣ **First Attempt:**  
   - If credentials exist in the **credential manager**, Docker logs you in automatically.  
   - If not, it prompts for authentication.  

2️⃣ **Login Process (If Not Already Authenticated):**  
   - Docker provides a **one-time device confirmation code**.  
   - You must **open the browser and enter the code** at `https://login.docker.com/activate`.  
   - Once authenticated, Docker stores the credentials securely.  

3️⃣ **Where Are the Credentials Stored?**  
   - **Windows:** Windows Credential Manager  
   - **macOS:** Keychain Access  
   - **Linux:** `pass` (Password Manager)  

---

### **What Happens When You Run `docker logout`?**  

🔹 Running `docker logout` removes stored credentials from your system.  
🔹 Next time you run `docker login`, you must authenticate again.  

This behavior ensures that credentials are not left behind, improving security.

### After the login do this:

### 🐳 **What you tried:**
You ran:
```sh
docker push hello-world-app
```
You expected it to push your Docker image to Docker Hub (your personal repository), but it **failed**.

---

### ❌ **The Error:**
```sh
push access denied, repository does not exist or may require authorization: server message: insufficient_scope: authorization failed
```

This means:
- Docker tried to push the image, but **it didn’t know where exactly to push it**.
- It **assumed** you wanted to push to the **default public Docker Hub repo** called `docker.io/library/hello-world-app`, which you don’t own.
- Since you don’t own that repo, Docker said “access denied.”

---

### 🧠 **Why this happens:**
When you **create** a Docker image like:
```sh
docker build -t hello-world-app .
```

You’ve only named the image locally as `hello-world-app`, **without any Docker Hub username or registry path**.

When you run:
```sh
docker push hello-world-app
```

Docker assumes you're trying to push to:
```
docker.io/library/hello-world-app
```

🔒 `library/` is reserved for **official images** on Docker Hub (like `nginx`, `node`, `ubuntu`, etc.) — you don’t have permission to push there.

---

### ✅ **The Solution – Tag it properly:**
Before pushing, you need to tell Docker:
> "Hey, I want to push this image to **my own Docker Hub account**."

You do that by **tagging** the image like this:
```sh
docker tag hello-world-app YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/hello-world-app
```

This tells Docker:
> “Push this image to `docker.io/YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/hello-world-app`” — which you own and have permission to access.

Then push:
```sh
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/hello-world-app
```

---

### 🔁 Summary:
| Step | What it does |
|------|---------------|
| `docker build -t hello-world-app .` | Builds a local image with a name (but not tied to your Docker Hub account) |
| `docker tag ...` | Gives the image a **new name with your Docker Hub username**, so Docker knows where to push it |
| `docker push ...` | Actually pushes the image to Docker Hub — and **now it works**, because it’s going to the right place |
