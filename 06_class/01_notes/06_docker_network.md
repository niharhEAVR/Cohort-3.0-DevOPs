## 🤔 Why Do We Need Docker Networks?

Imagine you have:

- A **backend container** (e.g., Node.js app)
- A **database container** (e.g., MongoDB)

They need to **communicate**, right?  
But how does your Node app know where the database is?

You can't just say:
```js
mongoose.connect('localhost:27017')
```

Because **`localhost` inside the Node.js container refers to itself**, not MongoDB.

🧠 That’s where **Docker networks** come in — they let containers talk to each other **by name** in an **isolated internal network**.

---

## 🧱 Think of Docker Networks Like a Private LAN

Just like your home Wi-Fi connects your laptop, phone, and printer — Docker networks connect containers **securely and privately**.

---

## ⚙️ Types of Docker Networks

| Type           | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `bridge` (default) | Used for **isolated containers** on a single host. Good for most apps. |
| `host` | Shares the host’s network. No isolation. |
| `none` | No networking. Useful for debugging or security. |
| `overlay` | Used across multiple Docker hosts (Swarm mode). |

We mostly use `bridge` in regular projects.

## 🧪 Example Without Docker Network (Broken):

```sh
docker run -d --name mongo mongo
docker run -d --name backend node-app
```

➡️ These two containers can’t talk to each other **unless** they’re in the **same network**.

---

## ✅ Example WITH Docker Network (Working):

### 1. Create a network:
```sh
docker network create my-network
```

### 2. Start MongoDB in that network:
```sh
docker run -d \
  --name mongo-db \
  --network my-network \
  -v mongo-data:/data/db \
  mongo
```

### 3. Start your Node.js app in that same network:
```sh
docker run -d \
  --name node-backend \
  --network my-network \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  node-app
```

### 🔗 Now they can talk like this:
Inside the Node.js code, you can connect to Mongo using:
```js
mongoose.connect('mongodb://mongo-db:27017')
```

- `mongo-db` is the **container name**.
- Docker's internal DNS resolves that to the actual IP address.

---

## 🛡️ Bonus: Docker Network = Security

- Containers can only talk to others on the **same network**.
- This limits unnecessary exposure.
- You can have **multiple networks** to isolate frontend, backend, database, etc.

---

## 📜 Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `docker network ls` | List networks |
| `docker network create my-network` | Create a network |
| `docker network inspect my-network` | View containers inside the network |
| `docker network rm my-network` | Delete a network |
| `docker network connect` | Attach a running container to a network |

---

## ✅ Summary

- Docker networks allow **container-to-container communication**.
- They're essential when running microservices, databases, APIs, etc.
- Containers can **talk by name** inside the same network.
- It improves **security**, **organization**, and **scalability**.
