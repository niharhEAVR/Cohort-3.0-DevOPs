### **What Are Layers in Docker?**
In Docker, **layers** are intermediate read-only snapshots of a container image. Each command in a Dockerfile (`RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.) creates a new layer. These layers are stacked on top of each other to form the final image.

### **Why Do We Need Layers?**
1. **Efficiency & Reusability** ðŸš€  
   - Docker caches layers, so if a layer hasnâ€™t changed, it is reused instead of being rebuilt.  
   - This speeds up builds and reduces bandwidth usage when pulling or pushing images.

2. **Minimized Storage** ðŸ“¦  
   - Layers allow images to share common base components, reducing disk space usage.

3. **Faster Builds & Deployments** âš¡  
   - Since unchanged layers are cached, rebuilding an image is faster because only the modified layers need to be rebuilt.

4. **Better Version Control** ðŸ”„  
   - Each layer represents a change, making it easier to track modifications in an image.

### **Example of Docker Layers**
Consider this `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18           # Layer 1: Base image
WORKDIR /app           # Layer 2: Sets working directory
COPY package.json .    # Layer 3: Copies dependencies file
RUN npm install        # Layer 4: Installs dependencies
COPY . .               # Layer 5: Copies the entire project
CMD ["node", "server.js"] # Final Layer: Runs the application
```
- If you modify **only the source code**, Docker will **reuse** layers 1â€“4 and only rebuild layers 5+.
- If you modify **package.json**, Docker **rebuilds from layer 3 onward**.

### **Cached vs. Not Cached Layers**
When building a Docker image, you'll see `CACHED` if Docker reuses an existing layer. If a change is detected, that layer and all subsequent layers are rebuilt.
