Let's break down the commands **after `curl`** and understand why they are needed for an AWS EC2 machine.

---

### 1️⃣ **`lsof -i :3000`**
🔍 **What it does:**  
- `lsof` (List Open Files) lists all open files and network connections.  
- `-i :3000` filters the output to show only processes using port **3000**.

✅ **Why on AWS EC2?**  
- When your Node.js app runs on an AWS EC2 instance, it binds to **port 3000**.  
- If the app crashes or another process is already using **port 3000**, you need to identify and stop that process.

---

### 2️⃣ **`kill <process id>`**
🔍 **What it does:**  
- Terminates the process with the given **process ID (PID)**.  
- The `<process id>` is obtained from `lsof -i :3000`.

✅ **Why on AWS EC2?**  
- If a previous instance of `index.js` is still running, it may prevent a new instance from starting.  
- **Example:** If your app crashes but the process remains active, you must **kill** it before restarting.

---

### 3️⃣ **`npm install pm2@latest -g`**
🔍 **What it does:**  
- Installs `pm2` (Process Manager 2) globally using npm.

✅ **Why on AWS EC2?**  
- AWS EC2 instances **don’t persist processes after a reboot**.  
- **PM2** helps manage Node.js applications, ensuring:  
  - Automatic restarts after crashes.  
  - Running the app as a background service.  

---

### 4️⃣ **`pm2 start index.js`**
🔍 **What it does:**  
- Starts `index.js` using `pm2` as a background process.  

✅ **Why on AWS EC2?**  
- Prevents the app from stopping if you close the SSH session.  
- Automatically restarts the app if it crashes.

---

### 5️⃣ **`pm2 examples`**
🔍 **What it does:**  
- Lists various examples and features of `pm2`.

✅ **Why on AWS EC2?**  
- Useful to learn how to manage processes efficiently on cloud environments.

---

### **Conclusion:**  
These commands help you **identify**, **stop**, and **restart** your Node.js app efficiently on an AWS EC2 instance. **PM2** ensures the app keeps running even after crashes or SSH disconnections. 🚀
