### **What is SSH Protocol?**  
SSH (**Secure Shell Protocol**) is a **secure way to remotely access and control computers or servers** over an **unsecured network** (like the internet). It encrypts your connection so no one can eavesdrop on your login details or commands.  

🔹 **Uses of SSH:**  
- Logging into remote servers (like cloud VMs)  
- Running commands on remote machines  
- Secure file transfers (using `scp` or `sftp`)  

---

### **What is SSH Key Pair-Based Authentication?**  
Instead of using a password to log in via SSH, you can use an **SSH key pair**, which is more secure.  

### **How SSH Key Pair Works?**  
An SSH key pair consists of:  
1. **Public Key** – Stored on the **server (remote machine)**  
2. **Private Key** – Stored on your **local machine (never share this!)**  

### **How Authentication Happens?**  
1. When you try to SSH into a server, your **private key** is used to prove your identity.  
2. The **server checks if your public key** matches the private key.  
3. If they match, you're logged in **without needing a password**.  

🔹 **Command to Generate SSH Key Pair:**  
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
It will create:  
- `id_rsa` (private key) – **Keep this safe!**  
- `id_rsa.pub` (public key) – **Copy this to the server**  

🔹 **To Copy Your Public Key to a Remote Server:**  
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@remote-server-ip
```

🔹 **To SSH into the Server Using the Key:**  
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@remote-server-ip
```

### **Why Use SSH Key Pair Instead of Passwords?**  
✅ More Secure – No risk of brute-force attacks  
✅ No Need to Remember Passwords  
✅ Faster and Automated Access  

Would you like a step-by-step guide for setting up SSH keys on a cloud VM? 🚀

Alright bro! Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to setting up **SSH key-based authentication** for a cloud VM. 🚀  

---

## **🔹 Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair (On Your Local Machine)**
1. Open **Terminal** (Mac/Linux) or **PowerShell/Git Bash** (Windows).  
2. Run this command to generate an SSH key pair:  
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```
3. When prompted:  
   - Press **Enter** to save it in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).  
   - If asked for a passphrase, you can skip by pressing **Enter** twice (or set one for extra security).  

✅ **This creates two files:**  
- **`id_rsa`** (Private Key) – Keep this safe on your machine! 🔒  
- **`id_rsa.pub`** (Public Key) – This will go on the server.  

---

## **🔹 Step 2: Copy Your Public Key to the VM (Remote Server)**
After getting the **public key (`id_rsa.pub`)**, you need to **add it to your server**.  

### **Method 1: Using ssh-copy-id (Easiest)**
Run this command (replace `user@your-server-ip` with your actual VM details):  
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@your-server-ip
```
- It will **copy the key automatically** to the correct location (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).  

### **Method 2: Manually Copying the Key (If ssh-copy-id Isn’t Available)**
If `ssh-copy-id` is not available:  
1. **Manually copy the key** to the server:  
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   - Copy the printed text.  
   
2. **Log into the server with a password**:  
   ```bash
   ssh user@your-server-ip
   ```
   
3. **Create the `.ssh` directory (if not already there) and add the key**:  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh
   echo "your-public-key-content" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chmod 700 ~/.ssh
   ```

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Log In Using SSH Key**
Now, you should be able to SSH into your VM **without a password**:  
```bash
ssh user@your-server-ip
```

---

## **🔹 Step 4: (Optional) Disable Password Authentication for Extra Security** 🔐  
1. Open the SSH config file on the server:  
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
2. Find these lines and change them to:  
   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   ```
3. Restart the SSH service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

Now, only **SSH keys** can be used to log in – making it much more secure! 🔥

We use **SSH protocol and SSH key pair authentication** mainly for **secure, passwordless, and automated remote access**. Here’s why:  

### **1️⃣ Security** 🔐  
- **SSH encrypts** your connection, preventing hackers from stealing login details.  
- SSH keys are **much harder to crack** than passwords.  

### **2️⃣ Passwordless Login** 🚀  
- No need to type a password every time you log in.  
- Prevents brute-force attacks (where hackers guess passwords).  

### **3️⃣ Automation** 🤖  
- Used in **DevOps** to automate tasks on remote servers.  
- Helps deploy code, run scripts, and manage servers **without human intervention**.  

### **4️⃣ Remote Server Access** 🌍  
- SSH lets you **control a remote computer or VM** from anywhere.  
- Essential for cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).  

### **5️⃣ Secure File Transfers** 📂  
- `scp` and `sftp` (which use SSH) help transfer files securely between machines.  

### **Example Use Case:**  
You have a **cloud server** hosting a website. Instead of using an **insecure password**, you use **SSH keys** to log in and manage the server safely.

## An example of ssh keypairs Vulnerability:


If your friend (or anyone) gains access to your machine even once, they could **silently add their public key** to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. This would allow them to connect **without your permission** at any time in the future.

### **How This Works (Attack Scenario)**
1. Your friend accesses your machine (physically or remotely).
2. They add their public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` like this:
   ```bash
   echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3...your_friend's_public_key..." >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
3. Now, from their machine, they can log into your machine **without a password** using:
   ```bash
   ssh your-username@your-machine-ip
   ```
4. You won’t get any notification unless you monitor SSH logs.

---

### **How to Protect Against This?**
✅ **1. Regularly Check Your `authorized_keys` File**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   - If you see an unknown key, **remove it**:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     sed -i '/unwanted-public-key/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

✅ **2. Restrict File Permissions**
   Prevent unauthorized edits by setting strict permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   chown $USER:$USER ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

✅ **3. Enable SSH Key Logging**
   Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and enable logging:
   ```bash
   LogLevel VERBOSE
   ```
   Then restart SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```
   Now, every login attempt will be logged in `/var/log/auth.log`.

✅ **4. Use `sudo` Restrictions**
   - If your friend has `sudo` access, they can do anything.  
   - Run `sudo visudo` and limit their privileges.

✅ **5. Disable SSH When Not Needed**
   If you rarely use SSH, disable it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable --now ssh
   ```

Would you like help setting up **alerts** for unauthorized SSH access? 🚀

You can set up alerts for unauthorized SSH access using **fail2ban**, **auditd**, or **custom scripts** that send notifications when someone logs in via SSH. Here’s how:

---

## **1. Enable Email Alerts for SSH Logins**
This script will **send an email notification** whenever someone logs into your machine via SSH.

### **🔹 Step 1: Install `mailutils` (for sending emails)**
Run:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mailutils -y
```

### **🔹 Step 2: Create a Script to Send Alerts**
Run:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/ssh-login-alert.sh
```
Paste this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
IP=$(who | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d '()' | head -1)
USER=$(whoami)
DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
HOSTNAME=$(hostname)

# Email details
TO="your-email@example.com"
SUBJECT="SSH Login Alert - $HOSTNAME"
MESSAGE="SSH login detected!\n\nUser: $USER\nIP: $IP\nTime: $DATE\nMachine: $HOSTNAME"

echo -e "$MESSAGE" | mail -s "$SUBJECT" "$TO"
```
**Save and exit** (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER`).

### **🔹 Step 3: Make It Executable**
```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/ssh-login-alert.sh
```

Now, every time someone logs in via SSH, you’ll **receive an email alert**! 📩

---

## **2. Monitor Unauthorized SSH Key Additions**
To detect if someone adds their SSH key to your `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file:

### **🔹 Step 1: Set Up a File Watcher**
Run:
```bash
sudo apt install inotify-tools -y
```

Then, create a monitoring script:
```bash
nano ~/monitor_ssh_keys.sh
```
Paste this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
FILE="$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys"
LOG="/var/log/ssh-key-monitor.log"

inotifywait -m -e modify "$FILE" |
while read path action file; do
    echo "$(date): SSH key file modified!" >> "$LOG"
    echo "ALERT! Someone modified your SSH keys!" | mail -s "SSH Key Alert!" your-email@example.com
done
```
**Save and exit**, then make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/monitor_ssh_keys.sh
```

### **🔹 Step 2: Run It in the Background**
Start monitoring:
```bash
nohup ~/monitor_ssh_keys.sh &
```

Now, if someone **adds or removes SSH keys**, you’ll **get an email alert** immediately. 🚨

---

## **3. Check SSH Logs for Unauthorized Logins**
To manually check SSH logins:
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "Accepted"
```
This will show all successful SSH logins.
