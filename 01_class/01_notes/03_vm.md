The image provides an explanation of **Virtual Machines (VMs)** and how they operate. Here’s a breakdown of what it conveys:

1. **Definition of a VM**  
   - A **Virtual Machine (VM)** runs on a physical server (also called the **host**) but is abstracted by a layer of **virtualization software** called a **hypervisor** (e.g., VMware, KVM).
   - The **hypervisor** divides the host machine’s resources (CPU, memory, storage) into separate virtual machines.

2. **How VMs Work**  
   - Each VM acts like a **completely independent machine** even though they share the **same underlying hardware**.
   - You can run **different operating systems** and applications in different VMs on the same physical server.

3. **Advantages of VMs**  
   - **Highly flexible and scalable** – You can easily create, modify, or delete VMs.
   - **Multiple workloads on a single server** – Useful for running different applications or services separately.

4. **Performance Considerations**  
   - The **hypervisor introduces some overhead** because it has to manage resources and ensure that each VM operates independently.
   - However, with **modern hypervisors and powerful hardware,** this overhead is **minimal**.

5. **Diagram Explanation**  
   - The **bottom layer (Hardware)** represents the physical machine.  
   - The **middle layer (Hypervisor)** is the virtualization software that manages VMs.  
   - The **top layer (VM1, VM2, VM3)** represents multiple virtual machines, each with its own **operating system (OS)** running on the same hardware.

In short, this image explains that VMs allow multiple **virtual computers** to run on a single physical machine using a **hypervisor**, providing flexibility and efficiency while sharing the same hardware.

The image lists several names related to **cloud computing and virtual server providers**:

1. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – A leading cloud computing platform by Amazon that provides services like virtual machines (EC2), storage (S3), databases, and more.  
2. **GCP (Google Cloud Platform)** – Google’s cloud service offering virtual machines, databases, AI tools, and more.  
3. **Azure** – Microsoft’s cloud computing service offering virtual machines, AI, databases, and enterprise solutions.  
4. **Civo** – A cloud service provider focusing on Kubernetes and developer-friendly infrastructure.  
5. **DigitalOcean** – A cloud provider known for its simplicity, used mostly for deploying virtual machines, applications, and containers.  
6. **Vultr** – A cloud provider offering virtual machines, bare metal servers, and cloud infrastructure with a focus on affordability and global data centers.  

These are all **cloud service providers** that offer computing power, storage, and networking resources for hosting applications, websites, and services.
