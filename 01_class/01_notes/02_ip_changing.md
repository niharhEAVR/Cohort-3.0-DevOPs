```bash
# goto ubuntu terminal:

nihar@DESKTOP-02PEG86:~$ sudo vi /etc/hosts
[sudo] password for nihar:

# press i
127.0.0.1   mylocalfacebook.com
# press ESC
# then type :w for save
# then type :wq for save & exit
```

now visit:

```link
http://mylocalfacebook.com:3000
```

if doesnot sees any thing then read carefully why its problamatic:

Since you're still facing issues, let's go step by step based on your test results.

### **What Happened?**
You ran:
```bash
curl -I http://facebook.com:3000
```
And got:
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect
```
This means:
1. Either `/etc/hosts` is not working properly.
2. Your local server is **not running** on port `3000`.
3. A firewall or another process is blocking the connection.

## **üöÄ Fix It Step by Step**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Your Local Server is Running**
Run:
```bash
netstat -tulnp | grep 3000
```
or
```bash
ss -tulnp | grep 3000
```
üëâ **Expected output:**  
Something like this:
```
tcp   LISTEN   0   128  127.0.0.1:3000   0.0.0.0:*   users:(("node",pid=12345,fd=10))
```
- If you **see output**, it means your server is running. ‚úÖ
- If there is **no output**, **start your server**:
  ```bash
  node server.js  # Or whatever command you use
  ```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Test if `/etc/hosts` is Working**
Run:
```bash
ping facebook.com
```
üëâ **Expected output:**  
```
PING facebook.com (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
```
- If it **does not** show `127.0.0.1`, your `/etc/hosts` is not working.  
- **Fix:** Restart DNS cache:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  ```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Connect to Port 3000**
Run:
```bash
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
üëâ **What you should see:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
- If this **works**, but `facebook.com:3000` fails, then the issue is with `/etc/hosts`.
- If this **fails**, your server is **not running** on `3000`.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Try a Different Fake Domain (Avoid `facebook.com`)**
Facebook uses **HSTS**, which forces HTTPS and bypasses `/etc/hosts`. Instead, try:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```
Change:
```
127.0.0.1   facebook.com
```
To:
```
127.0.0.1   mytestsite.local
```
Then, visit:
```
http://mytestsite.local:3000
```
**Why?**  
- `facebook.com` may be blocked due to security policies.
- `mytestsite.local` will work without interference.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Browser DNS Caching (If `/etc/hosts` Seems Fine)**
Try:
```bash
nslookup facebook.com
```
or
```bash
dig facebook.com
```
üëâ **Expected output:**  
```
facebook.com   127.0.0.1
```
- If it still shows a public IP, clear DNS cache:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
  ```
  or in **Chrome**:
  1. Open `chrome://net-internals/#dns`
  2. Click **Clear host cache**.

---

### **üîπ Final Solution If Nothing Works**
- Use `mytestsite.local` instead of `facebook.com`.
- Restart your local server.
- Ensure your browser is not forcing HTTPS.
- Restart DNS services.
