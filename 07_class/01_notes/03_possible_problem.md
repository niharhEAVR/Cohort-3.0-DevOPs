The error **"P1001: Can't reach database server at `postgres:5432`"** indicates that the `user-app` container is trying to connect to the `postgres` container, but it is not ready when Prisma tries to access it.  

#### âœ… **Verify PostgreSQL Container is Running**
Run:
```sh
docker ps
```
Make sure the `postgres` container is listed. If not, start it manually:
then delete all the containers and delete all images then restart the all over again

```sh
docker-compose up postgres -d # this is for postgres database install 
docker-compose up
```
