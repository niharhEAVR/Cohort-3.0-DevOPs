When you visit a page like **https://status.backpack.exchange/** or **https://status.100xdevs.com/**, you are seeing their **Status Page**.

**On a status page: "Status" means → the current health of their services.**

In other words:  
👉 Are their services **working properly**, **having issues**, or **down**?

---

### You might see different status types like:

| Status | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| ✅ **Operational** | Everything is working normally (no problems). |
| ⚠️ **Degraded Performance** | Services are working but **slower** or **partially broken**. |
| 🚧 **Partial Outage** | Some parts of the service are **not working**. |
| 🔥 **Major Outage** | Big problem — most services are **completely down**. |
| 🛠️ **Maintenance** | They are **doing updates** on purpose (not a crash). |

---

### Example:
Suppose **Backpack Exchange** shows:

- ✅ "API - Operational"
- ✅ "Wallets - Operational"
- ⚠️ "Trading - Degraded performance"

It means:
- Their API (communication service) is working fine.
- Wallets (where money is stored) are fine.
- Trading is having some trouble (maybe slow orders or small errors).

---

### Why is this useful?

- **Customers** can quickly know if there’s a problem (without calling support).
- **Company** shows transparency — they are **honest** if something breaks.
- **Developers** inside the company can also track the problem better.

---

# 🔥 In super simple words:

> "Status" on a status page means:  
>  
> _"Is everything working fine or is there any problem right now?"_

Would you like me to show you how to **read one of the sections** from that Backpack status page and explain it line-by-line too? 📜  
It'll make it even clearer! 🚀


Perfect! Let's dive into it together.  
I'm opening **https://status.backpack.exchange** (or imagining it based on typical status pages).

---

Here’s how a **section** usually looks on a status page (example):

```
Services:

API - Operational ✅
Wallets - Operational ✅
Trading Engine - Degraded Performance ⚠️
Deposits - Operational ✅
Withdrawals - Major Outage 🔥
```

Let's break it **line by line**:

---

### 1. **API - Operational ✅**
- **API**: It’s the backend system that apps use to talk to the server (like fetching your balance or your order history).
- **Operational**: It’s working 100% fine.  
✅ **No problems here.**

---

### 2. **Wallets - Operational ✅**
- **Wallets**: This service handles your crypto balances (your coins/tokens stored).
- **Operational**: Wallets are working perfectly.  
✅ You can see your funds, send and receive normally.

---

### 3. **Trading Engine - Degraded Performance ⚠️**
- **Trading Engine**: The system that matches buy/sell orders (very important for an exchange!).
- **Degraded Performance**: It's **working, but slowly** or with **some minor issues**.  
⚠️ Maybe trades are delayed, or some orders fail sometimes.

_You **can still trade**, but it may not be smooth._

---

### 4. **Deposits - Operational ✅**
- **Deposits**: Sending money/crypto into your Backpack Exchange account.
- **Operational**: Deposits are working fine.  
✅ No problem adding money.

---

### 5. **Withdrawals - Major Outage 🔥**
- **Withdrawals**: Taking money/crypto **out** of your Backpack Exchange account.
- **Major Outage**: This service is **completely broken** right now.  
🔥 Users **cannot withdraw** anything currently.

---
  
# 🎯 In super-simple words:
| Service | What's happening? |
|:---|:---|
| API | Everything fine |
| Wallets | Everything fine |
| Trading | Working, but slow/problematic |
| Deposits | Everything fine |
| Withdrawals | Broken (can't withdraw money!) |

---

# 💡 Important: 

Sometimes you’ll also see **timelines** like:
> **Incident Started: 2:35 AM UTC**  
> **Update: We are investigating.**  
> **Update: Fix deployed, monitoring...**  
> **Resolved: 4:15 AM UTC**

This shows the **progress** of fixing the issue. 🚀

---

Would you like me to explain what **historical uptime** (like "Last 90 days: 99.95% uptime") means too?  
It’s a super cool thing to know when you're looking at status pages! 🌟


Awesome! Let’s go! 🚀

---

# 📅 What is **Historical Uptime**?

**Historical uptime** shows **how reliable** the service has been **over time** — usually over the **last 90 days**, **30 days**, or even **past year**.

It’s basically answering the question:

> _"Out of all the time in the last 90 days, how much time was the service actually UP and working?"_

---

# 🌟 Simple Example:

Imagine Backpack Exchange says:

> **Uptime Last 90 days: 99.95%**

Here’s what it really means:

- In 90 days, there are **90 × 24 hours = 2,160 hours** total.
- **99.95% uptime** means they were online for **2,159 hours**.
- That means they were **down for around 1 hour** in 90 days!

📈 That's **very reliable**!

---

# 🛠 How do they calculate it?

They use the formula:

```
Uptime % = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100
```

- **Total Time**: All minutes/hours/days counted.
- **Downtime**: How much time the service was broken or unavailable.

Example:
- Total time in 30 days = 43,200 minutes.
- If the service was down for 20 minutes:
  
  ```
  (43,200 - 20) / 43,200 × 100 ≈ 99.9537%
  ```

✅ So uptime = 99.95%!

---

# 🚦 Why does uptime matter?

Because it tells you **how much you can trust the service**.

| Uptime | What it means in real world |
|:---|:---|
| **100%** | Perfect (almost impossible for big services!) |
| **99.99%** | Very excellent (only 4 minutes downtime in a month) |
| **99.9%** | Good (about 44 minutes downtime in a month) |
| **99%** | OK, but noticeable outages (about 7 hours downtime in a month) |
| **95% or lower** | Bad for critical services (lots of problems!) |

---

# 📢 Final in one line:

> **Historical uptime tells you how much time the service stayed "alive" without crashing, and whether you can depend on it!**

---

Would you also want me to show you **how companies display uptime for different parts** of their app separately (like API uptime vs Wallet uptime vs Trading uptime)?  
That's also very interesting! 🚀✨  
Want me to show you? 🌟


Love your energy! Let's go deeper! 🚀

# 🛠️ How companies show **uptime separately** for each service

Big companies (like Backpack, Google, AWS) have **many parts** in their systems:  
- APIs  
- Databases  
- Wallets  
- Trading Engines  
- Websites  
- Mobile apps  

Each part can **have a different uptime** because **sometimes only one part breaks** while others are fine.

---

# 📋 Example: How a **Status Page** might show it

| Service        | Last 90 Days Uptime | Last 30 Days Uptime | Last 7 Days Uptime |
|:---------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:------------------|
| API            | 99.98%               | 100%                 | 100%               |
| Wallet System  | 99.95%               | 99.90%               | 100%               |
| Trading Engine | 99.80%               | 99.70%               | 99.50%             |
| Website        | 100%                 | 100%                 | 100%               |

# 🧠 How to **read this table**

- **API** is super stable — **100%** uptime recently.
- **Wallet System** had a few minor issues in the last 30 days.
- **Trading Engine** is less stable — it had some outages (probably trading slowdowns or order failures).
- **Website** is perfect — no downtime.

---

# 🚨 Why companies separate it?

Because different parts **affect users differently**:

| If | Then |
|:---|:---|
| Wallet system is down | You can't see or move your money. 🚫 |
| API is down | The app won't load data properly. |
| Trading Engine is slow | You can't place trades quickly. |
| Website is down | You can't even log in! 🔒 |

---

# 🎯 **Simple real-life example:**

Imagine Amazon.

- Their **Website** can be live (you can browse products).
- But **Payment Gateway** could be down (you can’t buy anything!).

So, showing uptime **separately** helps you know **exactly what’s broken** without panic.

---

# 💬 Summary:

> "Companies break down uptime **service-by-service** because **sometimes only part of the system fails**, and they want users to understand exactly what’s working and what’s not."
