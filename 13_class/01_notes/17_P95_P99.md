# 🧠 What is p95, p99?

They are **percentiles**.

Used to measure **latency (response time)** in production systems.

---

# 🎯 Simple Meaning

Let’s say your API response times are:

```
100ms
120ms
150ms
200ms
300ms
400ms
2000ms
```

Now:

### 📊 p95 (95th percentile)

Means:

> 95% of requests finished within this time.

Only 5% were slower.

---

### 📊 p99 (99th percentile)

Means:

> 99% of requests finished within this time.

Only 1% were slower.

---

# 🧠 Why Not Just Use Average?

Because average lies.

Example:

Imagine 100 requests:

* 99 requests = 100ms
* 1 request = 10,000ms

Average becomes:

```
(99 × 100 + 10000) / 100
= 199ms
```

Average looks okay.

But one user waited 10 seconds 😬

Percentiles show this problem.

---

# 🧱 Visual Understanding

Imagine 1000 API calls sorted from fastest to slowest.

```
|----fast----|----normal----|---slow---|--very slow--|
 0%         50%           95%        99%          100%
```

* p50 → median
* p95 → slow users start here
* p99 → worst real-world experience

---

# 🔥 In Your Backend App Context

Suppose:

Your `/create-room` API shows:

| Metric  | Time   |
| ------- | ------ |
| Average | 120ms  |
| p95     | 450ms  |
| p99     | 1800ms |

That means:

* Most users → 120ms
* 5% users → 450ms
* 1% users → 1.8 seconds

That 1% might be:

* DB lock
* Cold start
* Redis delay
* AutoScaling spin-up

---

# 🧠 Why Companies Care About p95 / p99

Because:

Users complain when they are in the slowest 5% or 1%.

Google, AWS, Uber — they optimize p99.

---

# 🎯 What Each Percentile Means

| Percentile | Meaning               |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| p50        | Typical user          |
| p90        | Slightly slow users   |
| p95        | Noticeable slowness   |
| p99        | Very slow / edge case |
| p99.9      | Rare worst case       |

---

# 🚀 In Monitoring Tools (Like New Relic)

You’ll see graphs like:

```
Response time (p95)
Response time (p99)
```

Because percentiles show tail latency.

---

# 🧠 Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine 100 students finishing an exam.

* p50 → middle student
* p95 → 95th student (almost last)
* p99 → 99th student (very slow one)

---

# ⚡ Important For You As Backend Dev

When scaling:

* Average can look fine
* But p99 can reveal performance bottlenecks

That’s why SRE teams monitor:

> p95 & p99, not average.

---

# 🎯 Final Simple Definition

> p95 = 95% of requests are faster than this time
> p99 = 99% of requests are faster than this time

# 🏫 Example 1 — Classroom Exam

Imagine 100 students finished an exam.

You arrange them from **fastest to slowest**.

Student 1 → fastest
Student 100 → slowest

---

## 🎯 What is p95?

p95 = 95th student in that ordered list.

That means:

> 95 students finished **before or equal to** that time.
> Only 5 students were slower.

So if p95 time is **40 minutes**, it means:

* 95% of students finished within 40 minutes.
* 5% took longer than 40 minutes.

---

## 🎯 What is p99?

p99 = 99th student.

If p99 = 55 minutes:

* 99 students finished within 55 minutes.
* Only 1 student took longer.

---

# 🚗 Example 2 — Uber Ride (More Practical for You)

Imagine 100 people booked an Uber.

Their wait times:

* 80 people → got car in 2 minutes
* 15 people → got car in 5 minutes
* 4 people → got car in 10 minutes
* 1 person → waited 25 minutes 😬

---

### Average wait time?

Looks small. Maybe around 4–5 minutes.

But average hides the pain of that 25-minute guy.

---

### Now let’s check percentiles:

* **p95** → 95% of users got a ride within 10 minutes
* **p99** → 99% got ride within 25 minutes

Now you clearly see:

Most people are happy
But 1% had terrible experience

That 1% is what p99 shows.

---

# 💻 Now Apply This To Your Backend API

Imagine your `/create-room` API handled 1000 requests.

Response times:

* 900 requests → 120ms
* 80 requests → 300ms
* 15 requests → 800ms
* 5 requests → 3 seconds

---

### Average?

Maybe around 200ms. Looks fine.

---

### But:

* p95 → 800ms
* p99 → 3 seconds

That means:

5% of users are waiting almost 1 second
1% of users are waiting 3 seconds

Those users might complain.

---

# 🧠 Why This Matters For Real Apps

In production:

You don’t optimize for average.

You optimize for:

> “How many users are having bad experience?”

That is what p95 and p99 measure.

---

# 🎯 Very Simple One-Line Meaning

p95 = “Worst experience of the top 5% slow users”
p99 = “Worst experience of the top 1% slow users”

---

# 🧱 Visual Example (Super Clear)

Imagine 100 requests lined up:

```
Fast Fast Fast Fast ... Normal ... Slow ... Very Slow
1    2    3           95         99        100
```

* Position 95 → p95
* Position 99 → p99

That’s it.

No complicated math needed.

---

# 🔥 Why Companies Care About p99

Because if your app serves:

1 million users

1% = 10,000 users

That’s a lot of angry people.
