## 🔐 What is `known_hosts`?

It’s a **security file used by SSH** that stores the **identities (fingerprints)** of the remote servers you've connected to.

**File Location Examples:**
- On **Linux/WSL/macOS**: `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
- On **Windows** (PowerShell/CMD): `C:\Users\YourName\.ssh\known_hosts`

---

## 🧠 Why is it used?

### ✅ 1. To prevent **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks

When you SSH into a server, **you need to make sure you’re not being tricked** by someone pretending to be that server.

When SSH connects:
- It checks the server's **public key (fingerprint)**
- It compares it to what's saved in your `known_hosts`
  - ✅ If it matches → it connects.
  - ❌ If it **doesn’t match** → SSH **warns you** and **refuses to connect** (unless you override it).

---

### 🛡️ Real-life analogy:

Imagine you're calling your **bank**, and your phone shows **“Trusted Contact”** because you saved the number before.

If suddenly you got a call from an **unknown number claiming to be the bank**, you'd be suspicious, right?

➡️ `known_hosts` is SSH’s version of your phone’s “trusted contacts.”

---

## 🔄 What Happens Internally?

### 🔍 First Connection:
- SSH sees: “No entry found in known_hosts.”
- SSH says:  
  > “Hey, this is the first time you're connecting to this server. Are you sure you trust it?”
- You say **yes**, and it **adds the server’s fingerprint to known_hosts**.

### 🧾 Next Time:
- SSH checks the file.
- If the fingerprint **matches**, it connects **silently**.
- If it **changes** (like server was reinstalled or hacked), it says:
  > "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!"

---

## 🧨 What if you delete it?

If you delete `known_hosts`, SSH forgets **all trusted servers**.  
You’ll have to **manually confirm the trust again** for every server you connect to.

---

## 👀 What does it look like?

Each line in `known_hosts` looks like this:

```
15.206.117.182 ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJW3l9Ea7...
```

- `15.206.117.182` → IP of the server
- `ssh-ed25519` → the encryption algorithm used
- The rest → the server’s **public key fingerprint**

---

## 🔧 Bonus Tip: What is `known_hosts.old`?

- SSH automatically creates a backup of the file **before editing it**.
- So if something goes wrong, you can restore it.

---

## 🧩 Final Summary:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `known_hosts` | A list of trusted SSH servers your computer remembers |
| Used for | Verifying server identity before connecting |
| Why important? | Prevents hackers from pretending to be your server |
| Can you delete it? | Yes, but then SSH will treat all servers as new again |
| Does Windows & WSL share it? | No, they each have separate `known_hosts` files |

---

🔥 Awesome question — and yes, let’s **deep dive into this situation**. You're asking about:

> **Do the `known_hosts` and `known_hosts.old` files in Windows and WSL Ubuntu have any connection?**

---

## 🚨 Short Answer:

**No, they do NOT share or sync data automatically.**  
They are **separate files, managed by different SSH clients**, even though they serve the same purpose.

---

## 🧠 Long Answer: What’s Going On?

You have two environments:

| **Environment** | **File Location**                                | **Who uses it?**                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows (Host)** | `C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\known_hosts`          | SSH client in **PowerShell** or **Windows CMD**        |
| **WSL (Ubuntu)** | `/home/<your-ubuntu-user>/.ssh/known_hosts`     | SSH client in **Linux Bash (WSL)**                     |

Each environment has its **own SSH client** and **its own trust store (known_hosts)**.

---

### 🧾 What’s in `known_hosts`?

Every time you connect to a new SSH server, the client saves the server's identity (public fingerprint) in `known_hosts`, like a "trusted server list."

- `known_hosts`: current list of trusted servers.
- `known_hosts.old`: backup of the file **before the last change**, created automatically in case something goes wrong (like if you delete or change a line).

---

## 💥 Are they linked in any way?

**Not unless YOU manually copy/sync them.**

So if you:

- SSH from **Windows PowerShell**, it uses `C:\Users\<you>\.ssh\known_hosts`.
- SSH from **WSL**, it uses `/home/<you>/.ssh/known_hosts`.

They **won’t know what the other has trusted**.

---

## 🛠️ Can You Sync Them?

Yes — but **do it manually**:

### Example: Copy Windows known_hosts to WSL
```bash
# Inside WSL
cp /mnt/c/Users/<YourName>/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

> 🔐 Be careful — overwriting this file will wipe your WSL’s trust list.

Instead, you could **append it**:

```bash
cat /mnt/c/Users/<YourName>/.ssh/known_hosts >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Same goes the other way around.

---

## 🧪 How to Test Which File is Being Used?

1. Run:
```bash
ssh -v <your-server-ip>
```

2. Look for output like:

```
debug1: Will attempt key: /home/your-user/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: known_hosts: ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

This tells you which `known_hosts` file is being used.

---

## 🧘 Summary:

- 🔐 `known_hosts` is SSH's way of remembering which servers you trust.
- 💻 You have **separate SSH environments** (Windows and WSL).
- ❌ They do **not** share `known_hosts` unless you **manually copy or append**.
- ✅ You can sync them if you want — just be careful not to overwrite.

---

If you want help writing a small script to keep them in sync automatically — or want to understand how `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, and other key files interact with this — just say the word!
