### **Why Do We Have `dev`, `main`, and `production` Branches in a Git Repo?**  
Having multiple branches in a Git repository helps **manage development, testing, and deployment** efficiently. Each branch serves a specific purpose in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.

---

### **Branching Strategy and Deployment Workflow**
Here's how `dev`, `main`, and `production` branches are typically used:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `dev` Branch (Development)**
- **Purpose:** This is where developers actively work on new features, bug fixes, and updates.
- **Usage:**
  - All development happens here.
  - Developers create feature branches from `dev` (e.g., `feature-authentication`).
  - Merged via **Pull Requests (PRs)** after code review.
  - This branch is usually connected to **staging environments** for testing before going live.
- **Deployment Relation:**  
  - Code in `dev` is **not deployed to production** directly.  
  - It may be deployed to a **staging server** for testing.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `main` Branch (Stable Code)**
- **Purpose:** Contains **stable and tested** code, ready for production.
- **Usage:**
  - Once changes in `dev` are tested, they are merged into `main`.
  - Code in `main` is stable but may not be live yet.
- **Deployment Relation:**  
  - Often deployed to a **pre-production environment** for final testing.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ `production` Branch (Live Code)**
- **Purpose:** Contains the **code that is currently running in production** (live app).
- **Usage:**
  - Once the code in `main` is fully tested, it is merged into `production`.
  - This branch **should never contain untested or unstable code**.
- **Deployment Relation:**  
  - Code in `production` is automatically deployed to the **live environment**.

### **Git Workflow Example**
1. **Developer Workflow**  
   - Developers work on `dev`, creating feature branches.  
   - They merge updates into `dev` after testing.  

2. **Staging Deployment (`dev` ‚Üí `main`)**  
   - Once tested, `dev` is merged into `main`.  
   - `main` is deployed to a **staging server**.  

3. **Production Release (`main` ‚Üí `production`)**  
   - After final testing, `main` is merged into `production`.  
   - The **live app is updated** from the `production` branch.

### **Why Is This Important?**
- üõ† **Prevents Breaking Changes:** New features don't go directly to production.  
- ‚úÖ **Better Testing:** `dev` allows for testing before pushing to `main` and `production`.  
- üöÄ **Controlled Deployments:** Production stays stable while new features are developed.  
- üîÑ **Rollback Support:** If something breaks, you can revert `production` to a previous state.

### **Alternative Workflows**
Some teams follow different workflows:  
- **GitFlow**: Uses `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, and `hotfix/*` branches.  
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Developers work directly in `main` and use feature flags.
