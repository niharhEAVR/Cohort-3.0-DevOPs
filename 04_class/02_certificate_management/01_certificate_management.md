### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Set Up SSL for Nginx**
1. Run the following command to obtain and install the SSL certificate for Nginx:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

2. Certbot will:
   - Ask for your email address (you can skip it if you want).  
   - List the available domains configured in Nginx.  
   - Ask which domain(s) you want to enable SSL for ‚Äî select the number(s) from the list.  

3. Once you select the domain, Certbot will:
   - Automatically obtain the SSL certificate.
   - Update the Nginx configuration to use HTTPS.
   - Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Verify SSL Installation**
After the setup, you can check if the certificate is installed and working by visiting your website with **https://**.

You can also manually check the certificate status:
```bash
sudo certbot certificates
```

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Set Up Auto-Renewal (Optional) **
Certbot sets up automatic renewal by default using a systemd timer or cron job.  
You can test the auto-renewal with:
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

## ‚ùå **Step 6: Revoke or Delete Certificates (Optional)**
- To revoke a certificate:
```bash
sudo certbot revoke --cert-name example.com
```

- To delete a certificate:
```bash
sudo certbot delete --cert-name example.com
```
