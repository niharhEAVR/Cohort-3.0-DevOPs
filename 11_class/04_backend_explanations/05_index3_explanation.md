Let’s go through your **AWS + Node.js (TypeScript)** script **line by line**

---

## 🧩 1️⃣ Importing Required AWS SDK Clients

```ts
import { AutoScalingClient, DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand, SetDesiredCapacityCommand, TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling";
import { EC2Client, DescribeInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2";
```

👉 These lines import specific AWS service clients and commands from the **AWS SDK v3**:

* `AutoScalingClient` — used to interact with **AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**.
* `DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand` — lists all EC2 instances managed by an ASG.
* `SetDesiredCapacityCommand` — changes how many instances an ASG should maintain.
* `TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroupCommand` — lets you terminate an instance safely within the ASG.
* `EC2Client` + `DescribeInstancesCommand` — used to get **instance details** (state, IP, DNS, etc.) from EC2.

---

## 🧩 2️⃣ Creating AWS Clients with Credentials

```ts
const client = new AutoScalingClient({
    region: "ap-south-1", 
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY!,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!
    }
})
```

👉 This creates an **AutoScaling client** using your **AWS credentials** and region.
The `!` tells TypeScript that the environment variables are definitely defined.

Similarly for EC2:

```ts
const ec2Client = new EC2Client({
    region: "ap-south-1", 
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY!,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!
    }
})
```

---

## 🧩 3️⃣ Defining the Machine Type and Array

```ts
type Machine = {
    instanceId: string;
    dns: string;
    ip: string;
    isUsed: boolean;
};

const ALL_MACHINES: Machine[] = [];
```

👉 You define a **custom data structure** for each EC2 instance:

* `instanceId` → the AWS ID (e.g. `i-0ab12345...`)
* `dns` → public DNS name
* `ip` → public IPv4
* `isUsed` → boolean flag to mark if your app is using it

👉 `ALL_MACHINES` is a **global list** that always stores the current status of all machines in the ASG.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ Sleep Helper Function

```ts
const sleep = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
```

👉 A small helper to pause the code for a given time (`ms` milliseconds).
Used later to “wait” while AWS updates instances.

---

## 🧩 5️⃣ Wait Until Instances Are Fully Ready

```ts
async function waitForInstancesToBeFullyReady() {
    while (true) {
        const asgData = await client.send(new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand());
```

👉 Keeps looping until **all instances in ASG** are fully “ready”.

```ts
        const instanceIds = asgData.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId) || [];
```

👉 Extracts all **instance IDs** from the ASG.

```ts
        if (instanceIds.length === 0) {
            console.log("Still waiting — ASG hasn't fully registered instances...");
            await sleep(5000);
            continue;
        }
```

👉 If ASG hasn’t created or registered instances yet → wait 5 seconds and try again.

---

Next:

```ts
        const ec2Response = await ec2Client.send(
            new DescribeInstancesCommand({ InstanceIds: instanceIds })
        );
```

👉 Fetches **detailed info** (status, IP, DNS) of each instance using EC2 API.

---

```ts
        const allReady = ec2Response.Reservations?.every(reservation =>
            reservation.Instances?.every(instance =>
                instance.State?.Name === "running" &&
                instance.PublicIpAddress && instance.PublicDnsName
            )
        );
```

👉 Checks if:

* All instances are **in “running” state** ✅
* Each one has a **public IP and DNS** ✅

---

```ts
        if (allReady) {
            console.log("All instances have Public DNS & IP — FULLY READY!");
            return;
        }

        console.log("Waiting for PublicIP/DNS to be assigned...");
        await sleep(5000);
    }
}
```

👉 If all are ready → exit the loop.
Otherwise, print a message and check again after 5 seconds.

---

## 🧩 6️⃣ Function to Ensure Minimum 2 Machines Running

```ts
async function machineUpInitial() {
    const command = new SetDesiredCapacityCommand({
        AutoScalingGroupName: "bolt-asg",
        DesiredCapacity: 2
    })
    const data = await client.send(command);
}
```

👉 This ensures your Auto Scaling Group (`bolt-asg`) has **at least 2 instances running**.
It tells AWS to keep **desired capacity = 2** (ASG will launch new ones if fewer exist).

---

## 🧩 7️⃣ Refresh Instances — Main Logic

```ts
async function refreshInstances() {
    let asgData = await client.send(new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand());
```

👉 Gets the current list of instances from the ASG.

```ts
    let instanceIds = asgData.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId) || [];
```

👉 Extracts all instance IDs from that ASG response.

---

### 🔹 If No Instances Exist

```ts
    if (instanceIds.length === 0) {
        console.log("No instances found in ASG.");
        await machineUpInitial();
        console.log("Two instances Started in ASG.");

        await waitForInstancesToBeFullyReady();
        console.log("Instances are now running. Continuing...");

        asgData = await client.send(new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand());
        instanceIds = asgData.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId) || [];
    }
```

👉 If the ASG has no running instances:

* Create 2 machines.
* Wait until they’re **fully ready**.
* Then get the updated instance list again.

---

### 🔹 Fetch EC2 Details and Update `ALL_MACHINES`

```ts
    const ec2Response = await ec2Client.send(
        new DescribeInstancesCommand({ InstanceIds: instanceIds })
    );

    const freshMachines: Machine[] = [];

    ec2Response.Reservations?.forEach(reservation => {
        reservation.Instances?.forEach(instance => {
            freshMachines.push({
                instanceId: instance.InstanceId!,
                dns: instance.PublicDnsName!,
                ip: instance.PublicIpAddress!,
                isUsed: false
            });
        });
    });
```

👉 Uses EC2 API to get detailed info and builds a new array `freshMachines`.

---

### 🔹 Replace Old Machine List

```ts
    ALL_MACHINES.length = 0;   
    ALL_MACHINES.push(...freshMachines);

    console.log("UPDATED MACHINES:", ALL_MACHINES);
}
```

👉 Clears the global list and replaces it with the latest state.

---

## 🧩 8️⃣ Initialization and Auto-Refresh

```ts
await refreshInstances();
```

👉 On startup, ensure you have **at least two active EC2 machines**.

---

```ts
setInterval(async () => {
    await refreshInstances();
}, 10 * 1000);
```

👉 Every **10 seconds**, the app rechecks the ASG and EC2 info to:

* Keep `ALL_MACHINES` always in sync with AWS.
* Detect new or terminated instances.
* Automatically refresh DNS/IP info.

---

## ⚙️ Summary Flow (in plain English)

1. Start the app.
2. Check ASG for instances.
3. If none exist → spin up 2 machines.
4. Wait until those machines are running and have DNS/IP.
5. Save them to `ALL_MACHINES`.
6. Every 10 seconds → refresh that list again.
