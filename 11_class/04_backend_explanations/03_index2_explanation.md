```ts
import { AutoScalingClient, DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling";
import { EC2Client, DescribeInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2";

const client = new AutoScalingClient({
    region: "ap-south-1", credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY!,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!
    }
})

const ec2Client = new EC2Client({
    region: "ap-south-1", credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY!,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!
    }
})

async function refreshInstances() {
    const command = new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand();
    const data = await client.send(command);
    console.log(data);
    
    const ec2InstanceCommand = new DescribeInstancesCommand({
        InstanceIds: data.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x=>x.InstanceId)
    })
    const ec2Reponse = await ec2Client.send(ec2InstanceCommand);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(ec2Reponse.Reservations[0]?.Instances[0]?.PublicDnsName));
    
}
refreshInstances();
setInterval(() => {
    refreshInstances();
}, 10 * 1000)

### Importing AWS SDK Classes

```js
import { AutoScalingClient, DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling";
import { EC2Client, DescribeInstancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2";
```

✅ You import tools to talk to:

* Auto Scaling Group (ASG) — list the machines AWS is currently managing
* EC2 — fetch full technical details of those machines (public IP, status, DNS, etc.)

---

### Creating AWS connections

```js
const client = new AutoScalingClient({...})
const ec2Client = new EC2Client({...})
```

✅ You're **logging in to AWS two times**

* `client` → for Auto Scaling Group related info
* `ec2Client` → for direct EC2 instance details

(Both use same AWS region & credentials)

---

### Define function to monitor machines

```js
async function refreshInstances() {
```

✅ You create a function that checks the **current live status** of AWS machines.

---

### Step 1: Ask Auto Scaling — "Which machines are currently running?"

```js
const command = new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand();
const data = await client.send(command);
console.log(data);
```

✅ This returns a list like:

```json
{
  AutoScalingInstances: [
    { InstanceId: "i-0abc123...", ... },
    { InstanceId: "i-0def456...", ... }
  ]
}
```

So now **you know the instance IDs** of machines currently ACTIVE.

---

### Step 2: Ask EC2 — "Give me full details of these machines"

```js
const ec2InstanceCommand = new DescribeInstancesCommand({
    InstanceIds: data.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId)
})
const ec2Response = await ec2Client.send(ec2InstanceCommand);
```

✅ This fetches deeper info → Public IP, DNS, status, launch time, etc.

---

### Step 3: Print only **Public DNS (IP address to SSH / connect)**

```js
console.log(JSON.stringify(ec2Response.Reservations[0]?.Instances[0]?.PublicDnsName));
```

✅ This prints the **public URL** of the first machine, like:

```
"ec2-3-110-123-98.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
```

(You could instantly connect to this via SSH or browser)

---

### Finally — run it repeatedly EVERY 10 SECONDS

```js
refreshInstances();
setInterval(() => {
    refreshInstances();
}, 10 * 1000)
```

✅ First call runs instantly
✅ Then every 10 sec, it refreshes the AWS machine status again

---

### In ONE sentence:

This system **keeps checking live AWS machines every 10 seconds**, getting their **instance IDs from Auto Scaling**, then pulling **full public connection details from EC2**, and printing their **public DNS (IP address)**.

---
---

# Re-explaining the step-1 and step-2


### 🟢 Step 1 — Ask Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

> “Hey AWS, tell me which EC2 instances **you are currently managing**?”

```js
const command = new DescribeAutoScalingInstancesCommand();
const data = await client.send(command);
```

✅ Auto Scaling replies with **only basic info**, like:

* InstanceId → `"i-08b9c2d7..."` ✅
* LifecycleState → `"InService"` ✅
* Availability Zone → `"ap-south-1a"` ✅

❌ BUT it **does NOT give IP, DNS, RAM, CPU, etc.**
So now — **you only know the EC2 instance IDs**, nothing else.

---

### 🔵 Step 2 — Ask EC2 directly (more powerful service)

> “Now that I have the instance IDs — give me **full technical details** of these machines.”

```js
const ec2InstanceCommand = new DescribeInstancesCommand({
    InstanceIds: data.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId)
});
const ec2Response = await ec2Client.send(ec2InstanceCommand);
```

✅ EC2 replies with **detailed technical data**, like:

* Public IP ✅
* Public DNS ✅
* Instance Launch Time ✅
* Instance Type (t2.micro / t3.medium etc.) ✅
* CPU, RAM config ✅
* Running or Stopped ✅

---

### So **in plain English**:

| Step   | You are asking AWS…                                                     | AWS responds with…                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | "**Which instances are alive inside AutoScaling right now?**"           | Just instance IDs (e.g., `i-0abc123`)     |
| Step 2 | "**Okay, I know the IDs — now give me FULL DETAILS of those machines**" | Public IP, DNS, status, launch time, etc. |

---
---
---

# More indepth-explanation

```js
const ec2InstanceCommand = new DescribeInstancesCommand({
    InstanceIds: data.AutoScalingInstances?.map(x => x.InstanceId)
})
```

---

### ✅ What is happening here?

You are **preparing a request to AWS EC2** saying:

> “Hey EC2 — here is a list of specific EC2 machine IDs.
> Give me **full details** about ONLY these machines.”

---

### ✅ How is it getting the Machine IDs?

From **Step 1**, AWS Auto Scaling already gave you this:

```js
data.AutoScalingInstances = [
  { InstanceId: "i-0123456789abcdef0", ... },
  { InstanceId: "i-0abcdef1234567890", ... }
]
```

So `.map(x => x.InstanceId)` converts that to:

```js
[
  "i-0123456789abcdef0",
  "i-0abcdef1234567890"
]
```

This is exactly what EC2 expects — **a list of Instance IDs**.

---

### 🔥 In super simple English:

This line is basically doing:

> “Take all machine IDs from AutoScaling and give them to EC2 service — so EC2 can tell us **full details** like public IP, DNS, status, etc.”

---

| Final sent to EC2           | `{ InstanceIds: ["i-123", "i-456"] }`                  |
