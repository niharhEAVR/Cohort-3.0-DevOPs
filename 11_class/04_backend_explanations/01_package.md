These are **AWS service-specific SDK packages** (v3 modular AWS SDK for Node.js).

### 1. `@aws-sdk/client-auto-scaling`

This package lets your Node.js backend **talk to AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG) service directly**.

✅ Useful for:

* Increasing or decreasing **desired capacity** of an ASG
* Setting **minimum & maximum number of EC2 instances**
* Checking **how many instances are currently running**
* Letting AWS **automatically manage scaling policies** based on rules

Think of this as — *"Hey AWS, make it 5 machines right now"* → AWS spins EC2s automatically.

---

### 2. `@aws-sdk/client-ec2`

This is used to **directly control EC2 machines at instance level** (more low level).

✅ Useful for:

* `startInstances()`, `stopInstances()` → kill or boot individual machines
* Get instance **status**, IP address
* Tagging instances with `assignedProject: user123`
* Check if machine is idle or still running
* Creating new machines manually if required

Think of this as — *"Start this exact EC2 instance right now"*.

### How they fit into **your backend project**

| Task                                           | Which SDK do we use?  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Auto maintain minimum number of machines ready | `client-auto-scaling` |
| Scale up/down based on demand                  | `client-auto-scaling` |
| Assign a specific instance to a user           | `client-ec2`          |
| Stop an EC2 instance after 10 mins idle        | `client-ec2`          |
| Check instance health / running                | `client-ec2`          |

### In one line

* ✅ `client-auto-scaling` → **control the group-level machine count**
* ✅ `client-ec2` → **control specific individual machines for users**

This backend needs **both**:

* One brain that maintains **capacity pool**
* One that manages **per-user EC2 machines**
