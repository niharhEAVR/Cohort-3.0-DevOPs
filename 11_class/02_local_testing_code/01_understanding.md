When we **host VS Code in a web server**, the user expects that:

✅ The moment they open the link or log in — they should **instantly see a VS Code editor running inside the browser** (just like Replit or GitHub Codespaces).
✅ And **inside that VS Code environment, Node.js should already be pre-installed**, so they can immediately start writing and running Node.js code — without manually installing anything.

So basically, the user should feel like **they just opened normal VS Code on their local machine**, but actually it's running **inside an AWS EC2 instance from the cloud**.

Right now, **we are locally running VS Code inside Docker** — just to test how it works in a containerized environment.

This **same Docker setup will become our base image** — let's call it the **base-vscode-image**.

Later, when we deploy to AWS:

* We will **launch EC2 instances using this base-vscode-image** (so every instance already has VS Code + Node.js pre-installed).
* Whenever a new user needs a machine, the **Node.js backend will clone or boot a fresh EC2 instance from this same base image**.
* That way, **every user gets an identical, ready-to-use VS Code environment instantly — without setting up anything manually**.

This is how platforms like **Replit and GitHub Codespaces scale instantly** — all machines are created from a **pre-configured master image**.
