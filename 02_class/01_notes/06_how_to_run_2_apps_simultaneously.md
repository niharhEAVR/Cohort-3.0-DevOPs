I see what you’re doing 👍 You’re trying to define a **`start` script** in your `package.json` to run **two Node apps (`app.js` and `app2.js`)**.

Right now you have:

```json
"start": "node app.js && node app2.js"
```

### Problem

* `&&` means **run the second command only after the first one exits**.
  But in your case, `app.js` (Express server) **never exits** because it keeps running, so `app2.js` will never start.

---

### Fix

#### ✅ Run both at once with a helper (recommended)

Install [**concurrently**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):

```bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

Then update your script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"node app.js\" \"node app2.js\""
}
```

Now both will start together when you run:

```bash
npm start
```
