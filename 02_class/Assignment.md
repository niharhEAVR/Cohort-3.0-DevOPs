The image contains a to-do list related to cloud deployment and DevOps tasks. Hereâ€™s a corrected and structured version of the tasks:

1. Get a GCP account and set up the environment there.  
2. Replace Nginx with Traefik, HAProxy, or Apache.  
3. Try deploying a React app.  
4. Get a domain (e.g., from Namecheap).  
5. Try Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs).  
6. Manage SSL certificates yourself.  
7. Create a CI/CD pipeline to auto deploy to your server from GH.  
8. Learn about forever or PM2 (process management).  

It looks like a great hands-on learning plan! Are you planning to work on these tasks soon? Let me know if you need guidance on any of them. ðŸš€
