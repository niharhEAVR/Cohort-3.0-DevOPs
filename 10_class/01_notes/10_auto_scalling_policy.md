# 🌩️ AWS Auto Scaling → Dynamic Scaling Policies (Deep Explanation)

When you go inside your **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** in the AWS Console and click the **“Automatic scaling”** tab, you’ll see **3 types of scaling policies**:

---

## 🔹 1. **Dynamic Scaling Policies**

**Meaning:**
These are the real-time, metric-based scaling policies.
They monitor metrics (like CPU, request count, or custom CloudWatch metrics) and automatically adjust instance counts based on actual demand.

**Goal:**
Maintain performance under load *and* save cost when idle.

You can think of it like:

> “If load increases, add more servers; if load drops, remove extra ones.”

**Includes:**

* Step Scaling
* Target Tracking
* Simple Scaling

---

## 🔹 2. **Predictive Scaling Policies**

**Meaning:**
This is more advanced — it uses **machine learning** to analyze historical traffic patterns and **predict** future load.
Then, it automatically adjusts capacity *before* the load spike happens.

**Example:**

> If your traffic always spikes at 7 PM, AWS will automatically add instances around 6:55 PM.

**Goal:**
Stay prepared before demand actually happens.

---

## 🔹 3. **Scheduled Scaling Policies**

**Meaning:**
This is for fixed, time-based scaling.
You manually specify **when** to scale in or out.

**Example:**

> Add 2 instances every weekday at 9 AM; remove them at 6 PM.

**Goal:**
Handle known traffic patterns or working hours.

---

Now, when you click **“Create dynamic scaling policy”**, you’ll see **three options**:

# ⚙️ Types of Dynamic Scaling Policies

| Policy Type                 | Description                                                                                                             | Best For                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Step Scaling**            | Adds or removes instances in *steps* based on metric thresholds (e.g., “add 1 if CPU > 70%, add 2 if CPU > 90%”).       | Precise control over how much to scale. |
| **Target Tracking Scaling** | Maintains a *target value* of a specific metric (like “keep average CPU at 50%”). AWS handles thresholds automatically. | Simple, smart, and adaptive scaling.    |
| **Simple Scaling**          | Triggers a single scaling action when an alarm goes off (older method, replaced by Step Scaling).                       | Legacy or simple one-action use cases.  |

# 🎯 Now — Choose “Target Tracking Scaling Policy”

This is the most recommended option and the easiest to manage.
Let’s explore every single field you’ll see **when creating a Target Tracking Policy**, with what you’re doing at each step.

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step: “Target Tracking Scaling Policy” Setup

---

### 1️⃣ **Policy Name**

You’ll enter a name like:

> `TargetTracking-CPU50`

**What it means:**
This is just a human-readable name for your scaling policy — helps identify it later.

**Example:**

* `TargetTracking-CPU50` (for CPU)
* `TargetTracking-RequestsPerTarget` (for ALB traffic)

---

### 2️⃣ **Metric Type**

Here, you choose **what metric** AWS will monitor to decide scaling.

You can choose:

* **Average CPU utilization**
* **Average network in/out**
* **Application Load Balancer request count per target**
* **Custom metric** (CloudWatch)

**What you’re doing:**
You’re telling AWS *what “signal”* it should watch to detect demand.

**Example:**
If you choose “Average CPU Utilization” —
ASG will watch your instance CPU usage and keep it near your target.

---

### 3️⃣ **Target Value**

Here, you set the desired average value for that metric.

**Example:**

> Target Value: `50`

**Meaning:**
AWS will try to keep the **average CPU usage** of all instances around 50%.

* If average CPU rises above 50% → it adds instances.
* If average CPU falls below 50% → it removes instances.

**What you’re doing:**
You’re setting a *performance threshold* you want AWS to maintain automatically.

---

### 4️⃣ **Instances Need Warm-up Time**

This is **important** and often ignored.

When new instances launch, they take some time before actually starting to handle traffic (booting OS, loading app, connecting to ALB, etc.).

**What it means:**

* AWS waits for this warm-up period before counting the new instance’s metrics.
* Prevents premature scale-in (removing instances too early).

**Example:**

> Warm-up time: `300 seconds` (5 minutes)

**What you’re doing:**
You’re telling AWS: “Wait 5 minutes after launching a new instance before measuring its performance.”

---

### 5️⃣ **Disable Scale-in (Optional)**

If you **check** this box, AWS will only **scale out (add instances)** and never **scale in (remove)**.

**When to use:**

* If your app must never reduce capacity automatically (e.g., batch processing, or to avoid downtime).
* You want to manually control scaling in.

**What you’re doing:**
You’re telling AWS: “Add instances when needed, but don’t remove them automatically.”

---

### 6️⃣ **Predefined Metric Type** *(Appears only if you choose predefined metric)*

AWS offers some **ready metrics**:

| Metric                        | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASGAverageCPUUtilization**  | Monitors average CPU across all EC2s in ASG                     |
| **ASGAverageNetworkIn / Out** | Monitors incoming/outgoing network bytes                        |
| **ALBRequestCountPerTarget**  | Monitors ALB requests per registered target (good for web apps) |

**What you’re doing:**
You’re selecting the metric source that fits your application’s load indicator.

---

### 7️⃣ **Custom Metric (Optional)**

If predefined metrics aren’t enough, you can use **CloudWatch custom metrics**.

For example:

> You might push “Average response time” or “Active users” as a custom CloudWatch metric.

**What you’re doing:**
You’re teaching AWS to scale based on *your own app’s logic*.

---

### 8️⃣ **Cool-down Period** (Automatically handled)

Target Tracking automatically includes a **built-in cooldown**, so AWS doesn’t trigger scale actions too frequently.

You don’t have to manually configure this (unlike Step or Simple scaling).

**What you’re doing:**
You’re relying on AWS to avoid “thrashing” (rapid scale in/out).

---

### 9️⃣ **Estimated Instance Warm-up (Again at Bottom)**

Sometimes you’ll see this again in advanced settings — same idea as step 4.

Just confirm or adjust the warm-up duration based on your instance boot time.

---

## 🧩 Example Configuration

| Field            | Value                   | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Policy Name      | TargetTracking-CPU50    | Keeps CPU around 50%                     |
| Metric Type      | Average CPU Utilization | Use EC2 CPU metric                       |
| Target Value     | 50                      | Maintain ~50% average                    |
| Instance Warm-up | 300 seconds             | Wait 5 min before measuring new instance |
| Disable Scale-in | No                      | Allow both scaling up and down           |

---

## 🔁 10️⃣ What Happens After Saving

1. AWS automatically creates **CloudWatch alarms** in the background (for high and low thresholds).
2. When CPU increases above 50% for a while → it triggers **scale-out**.
3. When CPU decreases below 50% → triggers **scale-in**.
4. ASG updates desired capacity accordingly.
5. Instances are added or removed **automatically**.

You don’t need to manually manage alarms — AWS handles that for Target Tracking.

---

## ✅ Summary: What You’re Doing

You’re telling AWS:

> “Watch my system’s CPU (or any metric). Keep it near this target value.
> Automatically add or remove EC2 instances as needed. Wait for instances to warm up before measuring. Don’t overreact to short spikes.”

In short — you’re **teaching AWS to think like a DevOps engineer** and manage capacity for you, in real-time.
