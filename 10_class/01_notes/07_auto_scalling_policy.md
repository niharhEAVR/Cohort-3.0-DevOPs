But after all of these we are still scalling our app manually, so how can i scale it dynamically and explain it in very details
```

Excellent question ‚Äî you're totally right üíØ

If you‚Äôre **changing `Desired Capacity` manually** or **restarting instances manually**, that‚Äôs **not true auto-scaling**. It defeats the purpose of *‚ÄúAuto‚Äù Scaling*.

Let me now walk you through **how to scale your application *dynamically*** using AWS **Target Tracking Scaling Policy**, with very detailed explanations and real-world analogy. This is what makes Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) truly automatic.

---

## üöÄ THE GOAL

You want your app to **scale automatically** based on demand.

Examples:
- üß† If traffic is high, **more EC2s** should be added
- üò¥ If traffic is low, **extra EC2s** should be removed

---

## üéØ HOW TO ACHIEVE IT?

### ‚úÖ By using **Scaling Policies**

There are 3 types of scaling policies:

| Scaling Policy Type        | What It Does |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Target Tracking**        | Keeps a metric at a target value (like thermostat) ‚úÖ **Recommended** |
| **Step Scaling**           | Adjusts by steps if metrics cross thresholds |
| **Simple Scaling**         | Adds/removes instances based on one alarm |

We‚Äôll use **Target Tracking** because it‚Äôs:
- Simple
- Smart
- Self-adjusting

---

## üß† ANALOGY: Target Tracking = Thermostat

Imagine your CPU is like the **temperature** in a room.

You tell AWS:

> "Keep my EC2 average CPU usage at **50%**. If it gets hotter, turn on more fans (EC2s). If it cools down, turn some off."

This is **target tracking**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è STEP-BY-STEP: Add Target Tracking Scaling Policy

1. **Go to**: EC2 ‚Üí Auto Scaling Groups
2. Select your ASG
3. Click **Automatic Scaling** tab
4. Click **Add policy** ‚Üí Choose:  
   ‚úÖ **Target tracking scaling policy**

---

## üîß CONFIGURE TARGET TRACKING

| Field                    | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| **Policy name**          | e.g., `CPU-AutoScale` |
| **Metric type**          | `Average CPU utilization` |
| **Target value**         | e.g., `50` (means 50% CPU average) |
| **Instances need warm-up** | ‚úÖ Tick this (e.g., 300 seconds) |
| **Cooldown periods**     | Optional ‚Äî AWS will auto-handle using warm-up period |

This will tell ASG:

- ‚ÄúAdd more EC2s if CPU goes above 50% average‚Äù
- ‚ÄúRemove some EC2s if CPU goes below 50% for a while‚Äù

---

## üß† HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY WORK?

1. ASG continuously monitors **CloudWatch Metrics** (like CPU)
2. If traffic spikes and CPU jumps > 50%:
   - ‚úÖ ASG will create new EC2s using your **Launch Template**
   - ‚úÖ New EC2s will be **registered with the Load Balancer**
3. If traffic dies down and CPU drops < 50%:
   - ‚úÖ ASG will **terminate EC2s**, keeping minimum count

> ‚úÖ This happens automatically ‚Äî no manual intervention

---

## üí° WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS TO WORK

| Requirement | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Launch Template | With working User Data and app start |
| Load Balancer (ALB) | So traffic is evenly spread |
| Target Group | So health checks are accurate |
| `/health` endpoint | So AWS knows your app is healthy |
| Proper CloudWatch metrics | (e.g., CPU) ‚Äî enabled by default |

---

## üîÅ BONUS: Add Multiple Scaling Policies

You can also:
- Scale on **CPU usage**
- Scale on **Request Count per Target** (good for APIs)
- Scale on **Memory or Custom metrics** (via CloudWatch Agent)

---

## ‚úÖ SUMMARY

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | Setup Target Tracking Policy with CPU or other metric |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Attach it to your Auto Scaling Group |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | ASG will monitor & dynamically scale your EC2s |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Load Balancer will route traffic to active healthy instances |
