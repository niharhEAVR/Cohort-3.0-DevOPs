What about when we are doing it by github ci/cd pipeline then whats the way to reflect all the changes that made into the repo
```

Excellent! You're now stepping into **automated deployments** ‚Äî the real DevOps/production workflow using **CI/CD pipelines** connected with AWS üöÄ

Let‚Äôs break this into very **clear sections**, with detailed explanation and **a complete picture**:

---

## üß© GOAL: What You Want

When you push changes to your GitHub repo (e.g., updated code or new features), you want:

‚úÖ The app to **automatically deploy** to the EC2 instances inside your **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

‚úÖ All newly launched EC2 instances to have the **latest version** of your app code

‚úÖ No manual SSH, copy, build, or restart

---

## üéØ 2 Major Challenges

Let‚Äôs first understand the core **deployment challenges** when using ASGs:

| Challenge | Why it Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| ‚ùå New EC2s from ASG don‚Äôt pull latest GitHub code automatically | Launch template + AMI are **fixed snapshots** |
| ‚ùå Push to GitHub doesn‚Äôt update running EC2s or future ones | No sync from GitHub to EC2 |
| ‚úÖ We want dynamic scaling + latest code | So we need a pipeline in place |

---

## üí° SOLUTION: CI/CD with GitHub Actions ‚Üí Deploy to AWS

There are 2 main approaches to solve this:

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 1: Use EC2 User Data to Pull from GitHub Every Time**

### üîÅ Each time an EC2 is launched by ASG:
- It will **pull the latest code** from GitHub
- Install deps (`bun install`)
- Restart app (`pm2 restart`)

### You modify your **User Data script in Launch Template**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PATH=$PATH:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v22.15.0/bin
cd /home/ubuntu
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
bun install
pm2 start --interpreter /home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v22.15.0/bin/bun index.ts
```

> üß† If repo is private: use SSH or GitHub deploy tokens

---

## ‚úÖ **OPTION 2: Use GitHub Actions CI/CD to Deploy to ASG**

### Workflow:
1. You push to GitHub (main branch or any)
2. GitHub Action is triggered
3. GitHub connects to your EC2s (via SSH or SSM)
4. Pulls latest code, installs deps, restarts app
5. Optionally: create new AMI and new Launch Template
6. Trigger Instance Refresh in ASG

---

### üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Actions Workflow Example

**`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:**

```yaml
name: Deploy to EC2 Auto Scaling Group

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: SSH into EC2 & deploy
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
        username: ubuntu
        key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
        script: |
          cd ~/ASG
          git pull origin main
          bun install
          pm2 restart all
```

You‚Äôd store your **EC2 IP and private SSH key** in GitHub secrets.

---

## üîÅ OPTIONAL BONUS: Full CI/CD with AMI & ASG Update

If you want full **immutable infrastructure**:

1. CI/CD workflow does:
   - Run tests
   - Build app
   - SSH into EC2
   - Build new **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** with latest code
   - Create new **Launch Template version**
   - Update ASG with new version
   - Trigger **Instance Refresh**

2. This guarantees:
   - Every new EC2 uses the latest, tested image
   - No drift between instances

This is the **same model** Netflix, Airbnb, and Amazon use.

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL DECISION TREE

| You Want | Best Approach |
|----------|----------------|
| Quick updates + low traffic | SSH & pull from GitHub (in user data or CI/CD) |
| Full automation & immutability | Create AMI ‚Üí Launch Template ‚Üí ASG refresh |
| Best of both | GitHub Action builds new AMI + triggers ASG refresh |
