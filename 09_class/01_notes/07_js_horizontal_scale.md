### **What Does "Horizontal Scaling" Mean in JavaScript?**  

Horizontal scaling in JavaScript (specifically Node.js) refers to **running multiple instances of your application across multiple servers or CPU cores** to handle increased load. Instead of making a single server more powerful (**vertical scaling**), we add more **servers or processes** and distribute traffic among them.

### **Breaking It Down: Horizontal Scaling in JavaScript**  
1. **Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript (Node.js)**  
   - JavaScript (Node.js) runs on a **single thread** by default, meaning it can only use **one CPU core** at a time.  
   - If a single instance of a Node.js server gets **too many requests**, it can become a **bottleneck**.

2. **Horizontal Scaling = More Instances, Not More Power**  
   - Instead of making one instance stronger (adding more CPU/RAM), we create **multiple instances** and distribute the workload.  
   - This can be done:
     - On the **same machine** (using multiple CPU cores).
     - Across **multiple machines** (each machine runs a separate instance of the app).

3. **How Do We Distribute Requests?**  
   - A **load balancer** (like Nginx or AWS Load Balancer) is used to send requests to different Node.js instances.
   - Each instance **runs independently**, allowing the app to handle more traffic.

### **Real-World Example Without Code**
Imagine you run a **pizza shop** with only one chef.  
- If **many orders** come in, the chef gets overwhelmed (**bottleneck**).  
- Instead of making the chef work faster (**vertical scaling**), you **hire more chefs** and divide orders among them (**horizontal scaling**).  
- A **manager (load balancer)** assigns orders to the available chefs.

### **JavaScript Horizontal Scaling Example Without Clustering**
Let's say we run a **basic Node.js server**:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello from Node.js server!\n");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
```

If **thousands of users** try to access this server, it **won't scale well** because:
1. It runs **on a single core**.
2. It **can’t handle too many requests at once**.

To **horizontally scale** this:
- We can **run multiple instances** of this server (on different machines or different CPU cores).
- Use **Nginx** or a cloud service to **load balance requests** between these instances.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **JavaScript is single-threaded**, so by default, it can’t fully utilize multiple CPU cores.  
- **Horizontal scaling means running multiple instances** of your app across different servers or cores.  
- **A load balancer** distributes incoming traffic to different instances, preventing overload.  
- **JavaScript is great for horizontal scaling** because Node.js is lightweight and designed to handle multiple requests efficiently.
