```ts
import express from "express";
import cluster from "cluster";
import os from "os";

const totalCPUs = os.cpus().length; // Finds total cpu cores in my cpu

const port = 3000;

if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  console.log(Number of CPUs is ${totalCPUs});
  console.log(Primary ${process.pid} is running);

  // Fork workers.
  for (let i = 0; i < totalCPUs; i++) {

  }

  cluster.on("exit", (worker, code, signal) => {

> **In ths code how the cluster.isprimary is getting know that it is not a primary cluster and how it becomes false, and how did it know that the primary need to be true and also one thing is that using cluster module means that it will create a box and inside that box it will run a nodejs server and the box will run depends ony my total cpus**


Great question — let’s **demystify** what’s happening with `cluster.isPrimary` (or in older versions, `cluster.isMaster`) and how Node.js handles **multi-process clustering**. 🧠

---

### 🔍 Breakdown of your question:

#### ✅ 1. **What is `cluster.isPrimary` and how does it know when to be `true` or `false`?**

- When you run your Node.js script, **Node starts with one process**.
- That initial process is called the **primary process** (a.k.a. master process in older Node versions).
- When you call `cluster.fork()`, you're telling Node to create a **new child process** (called a *worker*).
- Inside these **worker processes**, `cluster.isPrimary` is automatically set to `false`.

📌 So:

```js
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  // This is the first process that starts
  // It manages the workers
} else {
  // This is a worker process created via cluster.fork()
}
```

> ✨ You don’t need to manually set `isPrimary`. Node.js automatically marks the original process as primary, and all `fork()`ed processes as non-primary (workers).

---

#### ✅ 2. **How does forking work with `cluster.fork()`?**

When you do:

```js
cluster.fork();
```

Node.js creates a **new child process** and runs the **same code file again**, just like re-running `node yourfile.js`. But the important part:

- In the **forked worker**, `cluster.isPrimary` becomes `false`, so it skips the forking logic.
- That’s how it doesn’t fork infinitely.

💡 Think of it like this:

```
Initial Process (isPrimary = true)
│
├── cluster.fork()
│   └── Forked Process (isPrimary = false)
│        └── Runs same script but goes into "else" block
```

---

#### ✅ 3. **How does this relate to CPU cores and vertical scaling?**

Yes, your understanding is **almost spot-on!**

- Each `cluster.fork()` creates a new **independent Node.js process**.
- These processes **can run on separate CPU cores**, effectively letting Node.js utilize **multiple cores**, overcoming the **single-threaded limitation**.

🏗️ So the analogy of a **"box" per core** is great:

```
Cluster (Primary)
├── Worker 1 (CPU Core 1)
├── Worker 2 (CPU Core 2)
├── ...
└── Worker N (CPU Core N)
```

Each worker runs an independent **instance** of your server — meaning they can all handle requests in parallel, distributing the load across cores.

---

### 🔁 Bonus: How cluster improves scaling

By default:

- Node.js: 🧵 Single-threaded, one CPU core used
- With cluster: 🧵🧵🧵 Multiple processes = better **CPU utilization** & **concurrent requests**

You still don’t get **true shared memory multithreading** (like Rust threads), but it’s the **next best thing** in Node.js.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Question | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| How does `cluster.isPrimary` work? | Node sets it automatically based on whether the process is the original or a forked worker. |
| How does it avoid infinite forks? | The forked processes detect `isPrimary === false` and skip the fork block. |
| Does this use multiple CPU cores? | Yes — each forked worker can run on its own core. |
| Is this vertical scaling? | ✅ Yes — you're using all cores of a big machine. |
| Is it the same as Rust threading? | ❌ No — it's multiple processes, not threads. But still effective for scaling. |

> **so that means when cluster froks a new worker then its  copies the whole code onto that worker and only changes cluster.isprimary makes false**


✅ **Exactly — you're spot on!**

When `cluster.fork()` is called in Node.js, here’s **what happens under the hood**:

---

### 🔁 1. **The worker runs the *same code file***  
Yes — the **entire file is executed again** in the new (forked) process.

But here's the catch:

```js
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  // Primary process logic: forking workers
} else {
  // Worker logic: start server
}
```

- In the **original process** → `cluster.isPrimary === true` → it forks workers.
- In the **forked worker** → `cluster.isPrimary === false` → it *skips* the forking logic and just runs the server.

So the **same file is reused**, but the `isPrimary` check makes sure that:
- Only the original process does the "management stuff" (like forking),
- And each new process acts as a worker.

---

### 🧠 Analogy: Copy + Role Swap

> Think of it like making **photocopies** of a script.  
> Every actor gets the **same script** — but when they read the line:

```js
if (I am the Director) {
    Assign roles to others
} else {
    Act in the play
}
```

Only the original actor (the primary) is the **director**. The others act. 🎭

---

### ✅ So to sum up:

| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| `cluster.fork()` | Spawns a **new process** that runs the **same code file** |
| What changes? | Only `cluster.isPrimary` is different (`true` for main, `false` for workers) |
| Memory? | Each worker is a **separate process** (separate memory, no shared variables unless using IPC) |
| Threads? | Still **single-threaded per process**, but you now have **multiple processes** to handle requests in parallel |

---

If you're curious about how communication happens **between** the primary and worker (like shared state or messaging), I can show you an example using `worker.send()` and `process.on("message")`!
