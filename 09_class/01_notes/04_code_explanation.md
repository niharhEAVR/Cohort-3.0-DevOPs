Great! Let’s break it down line by line so you can understand how **horizontal scaling** is achieved using Node.js’s **Cluster module**. 🚀  

---

# **📌 Understanding the Code:**
The goal of this code is to **utilize all available CPU cores** to handle incoming requests efficiently. Without clustering, Node.js runs on a **single thread**, meaning it can only use **one CPU core** at a time. By using **cluster**, we can distribute the load across multiple worker processes, each running on a separate CPU core.

---

## **🔹 Step 1: Import Required Modules**
```javascript
import express from "express";
import cluster from "cluster";
import os from "os";
```
- **`express`** → A lightweight web framework to handle HTTP requests.  
- **`cluster`** → Built-in Node.js module for creating child processes (workers) to share workload.  
- **`os`** → Used to determine the number of CPU cores available on the machine.  

---

## **🔹 Step 2: Get Number of CPU Cores**
```javascript
const totalCPUs = os.cpus().length;
```
- Retrieves the **total number of CPU cores** available.  
- Helps us decide how many worker processes to create (equal to the number of CPU cores).  

For example, on a **quad-core CPU**, `totalCPUs` would be `4`.

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Check if Process is Primary (Master)**
```javascript
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  console.log(`Number of CPUs is ${totalCPUs}`);
  console.log(`Primary ${process.pid} is running`);
```
- **`cluster.isPrimary`** checks if the current process is the **primary (master) process**.  
- The primary process is responsible for **creating worker processes**.  

Example output when starting the app:
```
Number of CPUs is 4
Primary 12345 is running
```
(`12345` is the primary process's PID)

---

## **🔹 Step 4: Fork Workers for Each CPU**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < totalCPUs; i++) {
  cluster.fork();
}
```
- Loops through the number of CPU cores and **creates a worker process** for each core.  
- Each worker is an **independent process** that handles incoming HTTP requests.  
- If there are **4 CPU cores**, this will create **4 worker processes**.

Example:
```
Worker 54321 started
Worker 54322 started
Worker 54323 started
Worker 54324 started
```
(each worker gets a unique process ID)

---

## **🔹 Step 5: Restart Worker if it Crashes**
```javascript
cluster.on("exit", (worker, code, signal) => {
  console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  console.log("Let's fork another worker!");
  cluster.fork();
});
```
- If a worker crashes (due to memory issues, errors, etc.), we log the event and **create a new worker**.  
- This ensures **high availability**—if a process fails, another one takes over.  

Example output if a worker dies:
```
Worker 54321 died
Let's fork another worker!
Worker 54325 started
```
(The new worker replaces the failed one.)

---

## **🔹 Step 6: Define Worker Process Behavior**
```javascript
} else {
  const app = express();
  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
```
- If the process **is not the primary process**, it means we are inside a **worker process**.  
- Each worker runs an independent **Express server**.  

Example:
```
Worker 54321 started
```
(`54321` is the process ID of this worker.)

---

## **🔹 Step 7: Define Routes**
### **Root Route (`/`)**
```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```
- Simple **"Hello World"** response for basic testing.

### **Check Which Process Handles the Request (`/pid`)**
```javascript
app.get("/pid", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Which PID handled this process: " + process.pid);
});
```
- Helps check **which worker process handled the request**.  
- If multiple requests are made, different PIDs will respond, showing that load is distributed.

Example output:
```
Which PID handled this process: 54322
```
(Next request might be handled by another process.)

### **Heavy Computation Route (`/api/:n`)**
```javascript
app.get("/api/:n", function (req, res) {
  let n = parseInt(req.params.n);
  let count = 0;

  if (n > 5000000000) n = 5000000000;

  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    count += i;
  }

  res.send(`Final count is ${count} at pid: ${process.pid}`);
});
```
- Computes the sum of numbers from `0` to `n` (heavy CPU task).  
- Limits `n` to `5 billion` to prevent excessive computation.  
- Returns the computed sum along with the **worker process PID**.  

Example request:
```
GET /api/1000000
```
Example response:
```
Final count is 500000500000 at pid: 54323
```
(Another request might be handled by a different worker.)

---

## **🔹 Step 8: Start Express Server**
```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening on port ${port}`);
});
```
- Starts the server on **port 3000** for each worker.  
- Each worker process **listens independently**, but the OS distributes incoming requests among them.

---

# **📌 How Does This Solve Horizontal Scaling?**
### **🚀 Horizontal scaling means scaling by adding more instances of a service**.
This code **scales horizontally** by:
1. **Using all available CPU cores** → Instead of running on **one core**, it runs on **multiple cores**.  
2. **Handling more concurrent requests** → Multiple processes share the workload, improving performance.  
3. **Worker Isolation** → If one worker crashes, others keep running, and a new one is spawned automatically.  
4. **Load Distribution** → Requests are handled by different processes, reducing overload on a single thread.  

---

# **📌 Without Clustering (Single-Threaded)**
```javascript
import express from "express";
const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => res.send("Hello World!"));
app.listen(3000);
```
- Runs on a **single core** (bad for performance).  
- All requests **go to one process**, causing bottlenecks.  
- Heavy CPU tasks **block other requests**.  

---

# **📌 With Clustering (Multi-Threaded)**
```javascript
import cluster from "cluster";
import os from "os";
const totalCPUs = os.cpus().length;
if (cluster.isPrimary) {
  for (let i = 0; i < totalCPUs; i++) cluster.fork();
} else {
  import("./server.js");  // Run Express server in workers
}
```
- Uses **all CPU cores**.  
- Requests are **distributed** among workers.  
- Can handle **more concurrent users** efficiently.

### But when i'm accessing the http://localhost:3000/api/5000000000 then i'm only seeing the single PID for multiple chrome tabs, how do i know that all PIDs are working togather




Great observation! 🔍 You're noticing that, even with the cluster module, the same **worker process (PID)** is handling multiple requests in your browser. Let’s break down why this happens and how to confirm that **all workers (PIDs) are working together**.

---

## **🛠 Why Are You Seeing the Same PID?**
1. **OS Load Balancing & Sticky Sessions**  
   - By default, the **Node.js cluster module** uses the OS to **distribute requests** among workers.  
   - However, OS-level load balancing might **keep sending requests to the same worker** for multiple requests from the same client (browser).  
   - This happens due to **sticky sessions**, where the OS routes connections from the same client (Chrome) to the same worker.  

2. **Keep-Alive Connections in Chrome**  
   - Browsers (like Chrome) **reuse connections** (via keep-alive) for multiple requests to the same server.  
   - This means that multiple tabs in Chrome might not trigger a new worker selection.

---

## **✅ How to Confirm That All Workers Are Handling Requests**
### **🔹 Method 1: Send Requests Using Different Terminals**
Instead of using the browser, use `curl` or `Postman` to send multiple requests.

Run these in **separate terminal windows**:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/pid
```
or
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/1000000000
```
**Expected output (different PIDs responding):**
```
Which PID handled this process: 54321
```
```
Which PID handled this process: 54322
```
```
Which PID handled this process: 54323
```
This proves that different worker processes are handling requests!
