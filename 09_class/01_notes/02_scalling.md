### **Vertical Scaling vs. Horizontal Scaling**  
1. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)**:  
   - Increases the capacity of a **single machine** by adding more **CPU, RAM, or disk space**.  
   - Example: Upgrading a server from **16GB RAM** to **64GB RAM** to handle more load.  
   - **Limitations**:
     - Expensive as hardware upgrades are costly.
     - Physical limit to how much a single machine can scale.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)**:  
   - Increases capacity by **adding more machines (nodes/servers)** to distribute the load.  
   - Example: Instead of upgrading a single server, **multiple servers** work together.  
   - **Advantages**:
     - More scalable than vertical scaling.
     - Fault tolerance is better (if one server fails, others can handle the load).

### **Why JavaScript Limits Vertical Scaling?**  
JavaScript is **single-threaded** by design (in the context of Node.js).  
- **Single-Threaded Execution**: JavaScript runs on a single thread (except for worker threads).
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: JavaScript (Node.js) does not efficiently use multiple cores.
- **High CPU Tasks Block Execution**: Since JavaScript uses an event loop, CPU-heavy tasks **block the entire process**, affecting performance.

### **How Rust Helps in Vertical Scaling?**  
Rust allows efficient **multi-threading** and **parallel execution**, making it great for vertical scaling:  
- **Multi-Threading**: Rust can efficiently use **all CPU cores** instead of just one.  
- **Memory Safety without Garbage Collection**: Unlike JavaScript, Rust has **zero-cost abstractions** and **no runtime GC**, making execution faster.  
- **Efficient Performance**: Rust compiles to highly optimized machine code, improving single-machine performance.  

### **Conclusion**  
- **JavaScript (Node.js) is better suited for horizontal scaling** (adding more servers).  
- **Rust allows vertical scaling** by fully utilizing a powerful machineâ€™s hardware through **multi-threading and efficient memory management**.
