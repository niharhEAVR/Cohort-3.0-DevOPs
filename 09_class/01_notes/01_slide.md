### Todays class slide link:

```link
https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/hor-ver-scaling/Horizontal-and-vertical-scaling--Indexes-in-DBs-1
```

- There is a catch for this class and that is the slide has 11 pages but the class only goes upto page 4

- rest will do by your own or wait for future calsses so that those slides can be used later
